# What is a monocular depth network?

A monocular depth network is (generally) a CNN able to infer 
the depth of the scene from a single image. We use a CNN because of the
complexity of this task.

# Why depth is important?
We can use depth information in many applications, such as Augmented Reality (AR),
3D Reconstruction, Collision Avoidance and many others.
We can obtain these data using *active sensors*, such as LiDAR or ToF, but also with passive ones like
stereo cameras. However, many devices do not have multiple cameras or active sensors, so monocular depth estimation
is attractive since it requires just a single camera. For many of these, (near) real time performances are necessary.

# What do I need to run a monocular depth network?
In general, you may need high performance devices, like a GPU, because many state-of-the-art networks
leverage million of parameters (eg 50 M, or even 100M). This means that they are not able to run with high FPS
on mobile or embedded devices. On the contrary, in this project we deploy a lightweight network, called [PyDNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11430.pdf)
that is able to run directly on mobile devices.
We both developed a mobile application (for Android and iOS devices), but they have to been installed. Instead, in this demo, you can run the network on your device just using your
browser. Indeed, using [TensorFlow JS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) the network runs inside the client device, and not in the remote server

# Why client-side inference is great?
First, the client does not need to share user images with the server, since they are processed locally in the client device, thus enhancing the privacy of the user.
Moreover, the server can scale better, since it has less tasks to solve.
For instance, suppose you have to serve 1k people: in a client-server application all the clients send a request to the server, which has to take the images, process them and send back to the client
the outcomes. If the users now become 10k, or even more, you may have to replicate more servers. Instead, if each client is able to process the images on its own
then the server may serve more clients!
You might argue that the server is necessary to provide the web page, and you have right. But
in the native mobile application we run server-less! This is also great, because we have gained in terms of dependencies: we can run the app even where, for instance, a good internet connection is not
available.
